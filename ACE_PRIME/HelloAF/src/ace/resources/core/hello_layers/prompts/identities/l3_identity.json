      "header": "FIGLET",
      "body": "`figlet` is a versatile program that generates large text banners in various typefaces, ideal for creating standout text displays. To use `figlet`, you can input a string of text and apply a range of fonts and styles. Here's how to utilize its key features and options:\n\n- Basic Usage: To generate a basic text banner, simply type `figlet` followed by your text. For example, `figlet Hello World` will create a large-scale representation of 'Hello World'.\n\n- Font Selection: `figlet` comes with several built-in fonts. Use the `-f` option to specify a font. For example, `figlet -f slant Hello World` uses the 'slant' font.\n\n- Layout Options: Control the output layout with flags like `-c` for centering, `-l` for left-aligning, or `-r` for right-aligning the text. For instance, `figlet -c Hello World` will center the text.\n\n- Width Adjustment: The `-w` option lets you set a specific width for the output. For example, `figlet -w 100 Hello World` sets the width to 100 characters.\n\n- Smushing: Control the horizontal spacing between characters with smushing options. For instance, `-W` for full-width mode prevents character overlap.\n\n- List Fonts: To view available fonts, use `figlet -l`.\n\n- Custom Fonts: You can use custom font files (in `.flf` format) with `figlet` by specifying the path to the font file with the `-f` option.\n\nThese features make `figlet` a powerful tool for creating visually impactful text-based displays. Experiment with different combinations of text, fonts, and layout options to create the desired effect for your banners and messages."

      "body": "`toilet` is a powerful text-based program designed for creating styled and colorful text banners. It offers a range of fonts, colors, and effects to enhance text displays. Here's how to utilize `toilet` effectively with its various options and flags:\n\n- Basic Usage: Simply type `toilet` followed by your text to generate a basic banner. For example, `toilet Hello World` creates a standard banner with 'Hello World'.\n\n- Font Selection: Use the `-f` option to choose a font. `toilet` supports various fonts, similar to `figlet`. For example, `toilet -f mono12 Hello World` uses the 'mono12' font.\n\n- Color Output: Add color to your text with the `--color` or `-c` flag. You can specify colors like `red`, `green`, `blue`, etc. For instance, `toilet --color=green Hello World` produces green text.\n\n- Filter Effects: Apply effects using filters. The `--gay` filter adds a rainbow color effect, and the `--metal` filter gives a metallic color effect. For example, `toilet --gay Hello World` creates a rainbow-colored text banner.\n\n- Export Formats: Export the output in various formats using the `-E` option. Formats include `html`, `svg`, etc. For example, `toilet -E html Hello World` exports the output in HTML format.\n\n- Border: Add a border around the text with the `-b` option. For example, `toilet -b Hello World` puts a border around the text banner.\n\n- Width Adjustment: Use `-w` to set a specific output width. For example, `toilet -w 100 Hello World` sets the width to 100 characters.\n\n`toilet` is excellent for creating eye-catching and stylistic text banners, offering enhanced aesthetic choices over `figlet`. Experiment with different fonts, colors, and effects to achieve unique and creative text displays for various applications."

      "body": "`cowsay` is a playful and entertaining program that generates ASCII art of a cow with a speech bubble containing your message. It's a fun way to display messages and adds a touch of humor to your outputs. Here's how to use `cowsay` with its various options:\n\n- Basic Usage: To create a simple cow saying your message, type `cowsay` followed by your text. For instance, `cowsay Hello World` will show an ASCII cow saying 'Hello World'.\n\n- Custom Eyes and Tongue: Change the cow's eyes with `-e` and the tongue with `-T`. For example, `cowsay -e @@ -T U Hello World` makes the cow have '@@' eyes and a 'U' shaped tongue.\n\n- Different Characters: Besides the default cow, `cowsay` can use other characters. Use the `-f` option followed by the character's name. For instance, `cowsay -f tux Hello World` will use Tux the penguin instead of the cow.\n\n- Think Mode: Instead of saying, make the cow 'think' your message using `-t`. For example, `cowsay -t Hello World` shows a thinking bubble instead of a speech bubble.\n\n- List Characters: To see all available characters, use `cowsay -l`. You can choose any character from this list for your message.\n\n- Custom ASCII Art: Advanced users can create custom ASCII art characters for use with `cowsay` by following the format used in the existing character files.\n\n`cowsay` is an excellent tool for adding a light-hearted element to your textual outputs. Its flexibility in character choice and message presentation makes it a popular choice for informal and engaging text displays."
